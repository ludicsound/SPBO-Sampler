Crotale samples information:

Congratulations on becoming the proud owner of a complete set of quartertone crotale samples.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no real world crotales tuned in quartertones.  I recorded a full 13-note octave, and pitch-shifted the lower 12 up by 500 cents.  Assuming that the initial set was tuned in equal temperament, these pitch-shifted samples should be exactly between the original chromatic notes.  The attacks have been compressed slightly due to their initial over-bearing qualities, and I attempted to even out all other volume discrepancies in order to make the 25 samples relatively equal in volume.

For those who care:
These samples were recorded with a Pacific Pro Audio LD-1 large diaphragm condenser microphone positioned approximately 12 inches above the crotales.  The signal ran through a Demeter HXM-1 tube preamp, and into a Digidesign 888 interface.

Feel free to use these samples whenever they might be useful.  Send me an e-mail if they end up in any pieces of music.
